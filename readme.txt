Replace "Howdy, {name}" with a custom message. Use <code>{name}</code> for the user's display name. For example <code>Hi, {name}!</code>. Leave empty for no greeting. Use <code>default</code> for the default greeting, preventing the tweak from running.

WP really hates privacy and sends this <code>WordPress/1.0; https://example.org</code> to every site it makes calls to. You can empty the field, pretend to be Chrome <code>Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/131.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</code> or something else. <code>default</code> will change nothing.

Unlike WP Code's snippet database that is filled with low code quality tweaks where some do not even work at all and spam this plugin only contains high quality tweaks. If something is missing please add it.

It is very easy to contribute to the plugin. Check out the [Github Readme](https://github.com/nextgenthemes/tweakmaster/blob/master/readme.md).
